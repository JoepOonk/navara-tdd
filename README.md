# Test-Driven Development Materials

Welcome to this repository that is literally packed with test-driven development (TDD) materials!
This repository contains a huge collection of coding katas with instructions in various languages, 
sample solutions, presentations, etc.

Be sure to also check out the information on 
[coding katas](https://github.com/zhendrikse/tdd/wiki/The-Coding-Katas), 
[coding dojos](https://github.com/zhendrikse/tdd/wiki/The-Katas-and-the-Coding-Dojo), 
[how they relate to the 24 DevOps key capabilities](https://github.com/zhendrikse/tdd/wiki/The-Katas-and-the-24-Key-Capabilities), 
and much more on
the [wiki pages that are part of this repository](https://github.com/zhendrikse/tdd/wiki).

## For coaches

The materials found here can be seamlessly integrated into 
[the Samman coaching method](https://www.sammancoaching.org/) and
are ready to be used in cloud development environments (CDEs) such
as [replit.com](https://replit.com), 
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), 
or [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io). They cay also be
used in [coding dojos](https://github.com/zhendrikse/tdd/wiki/The-Katas-and-the-Coding-Dojo).

## For practitioners

Coding katas remain an unlimited source of practice and inspiration
to sharpen your skills as a (TDD) practitioner.
