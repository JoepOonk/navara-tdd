# TTD materials

Test-driven development is a lot of fun, and a
great form of "deliberate practice".  You have arrived at the right
place, you'll fin here everything to get you up and running!

# About coding katas

> Japanese culture influenced a lot software and project management fields. 
> Concepts like [Lean](https://apiumhub.com/?p=55302), [Kata](https://apiumhub.com/?p=4044), etc 
> has come from Japan. And we should admit, that they have improved the existing processes, 
> increasing efficiency and satisfaction overall &#8212; [apiumhub.com](https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/code-kata/)

With the materials in this repository you'll learn TDD by practicing 
so-called [coding katas](https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/code-kata/):

> A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. 
> The intent behind code kata is similar &#8212; [codekata.com](http://codekata.com/) 

Generally speaking, each kata tries to target one or more skills, 
and this curriculum is no exception to that general rule. As the saying goes, 
practice makes perfect, and the same holds for (coding) katas: preferably 
you make them your own by repeating them _time and again_.

## Katas to practice TDD

Although the basic rules of TDD are relatively straightforward, 
TDD turns out to be a skill and as such, has to be acquired. 
Like playing piano. Like practicing martial arts in a dojo by executing 
katas time and again!

And although the saying goes that practice makes perfect, the reality is 
that code almost never reaches a perfect state: you can always find ways to 
further improve your code and your skill(s). Likewise with TDD, your TDD journey 
definitely won't stop after completing this course. There are always new ways to 
become more proficient and faster. Luckily, it turns out that mastery 
(from [Daniel Pink's Autonomy Mastery Purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)) 
is one of the three primary drivers that keeps us motivated. Moreover, the pay-off of
mastering TDD is much higher than the investments that you'll put in. 

After spending a certain time with TDD, people claim that there is no 
other way to develop a software. It is almost a learning to type with ten 
fingers: once you master the skill, you wonder how you ever managed without it.

The primary focus of all katas in this repository will be on TDD, but 
obviously many other programming ascpects will be practiced along the way! 
Among these are [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)), 
[single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle), 
[clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), 
[approval testing](https://approvaltests.com/), [mutation testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing), 
[lift-up conditional refactoring](https://www.eficode.com/blog/advanced-testing-refactoring-techniques-2), to name but a few.
