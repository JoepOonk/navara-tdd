# Test-driven development materials

TDD entails so much more than the well-known but trite red-green-refactor phrase.
More accurately, it is a great form of _deliberate practice_, in which a set of
**skills, principles, and heuristics** are continually combined to build quality in.

Last but not least, TDD is a lot of fun. You have arrived at the right
place to learn everything about it and to get you up and running
in the wink of an eye!

###  Level up your TDD skills

Please consult the [readme in the tdd-katas folder](./tdd-katas/README.md)
to learn more about which katas address which topics at which difficulty 
level and how they relate to the 
[24 key capabilities to drive improvement in software delivery](https://itrevolution.com/articles/24-key-capabilities-to-drive-improvement-in-software-delivery/).

### Coaching

These materials may seamlessly be incorporated into 
[the Samman coaching method](https://www.sammancoaching.org/) and
are ready to be used in cloud development environments (CDEs) such
as [replit.com](https://replit.com), 
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), 
or [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io)

# About coding katas

> Japanese culture influenced a lot of software and project management fields. 
> Concepts like [Lean](https://apiumhub.com/?p=55302), [Kata](https://apiumhub.com/?p=4044), etc 
> has come from Japan. And we should admit, that they have improved the existing processes, 
> increasing efficiency and satisfaction overall &#8212; [apiumhub.com](https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/code-kata/)

With the materials in this repository, you'll learn TDD by practicing 
so-called [coding katas](https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/code-kata/):

![Kata](./assets/kata.png)

> A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. 
> The intent behind code kata is similar &#8212; [codekata.com](http://codekata.com/) 

Generally speaking, each kata tries to target one or more skills, 
and this collection is no exception to that general rule. As the saying goes, 
practice makes perfect, and the same holds for (coding) katas: preferably 
you make them your own by repeating them _time and again_.

## Katas to practice TDD

Although the basic rules of TDD are relatively straightforward, 
TDD turns out to be a skill and as such, has to be acquired. 
Like playing piano. Like practicing martial arts in a dojo by executing 
katas time and again!

And although the saying goes that practice makes perfect, the reality is 
that code almost never reaches a perfect state: you can always find ways to 
further improve your code and your skill(s). Likewise with TDD, your TDD journey 
definitely won't stop after completing this course. There are always new ways to 
become more proficient and faster. Luckily, it turns out that mastery 
(from [Daniel Pink's Autonomy Mastery Purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)) 
is one of the three primary drivers that keep us motivated. Moreover, the payoff of
mastering TDD is much higher than the investments that you'll put in. 

After spending a certain time with TDD, people claim that there is no 
other way to develop software. It is almost a learning to type with ten 
fingers: once you master the skill, you wonder how you ever managed without it.

The primary focus of all katas in this repository will be on TDD, but 
obviously, many other programming aspects will be practiced along the way! 
Among these are [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)), 
[single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle), 
[clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), 
[approval testing](https://approvaltests.com/), [mutation testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing), 
[lift-up conditional refactoring](https://www.eficode.com/blog/advanced-testing-refactoring-techniques-2), to name but a few.  

 

# Learning Goals

![Skills](./assets/skillz.png)

By practicing these katas, you will:

- be confident to apply both TDD and BDD (behavior-driven development) in day-to-day work by writing executable specifications as opposed to unit tests that are tightly coupled to implementation.
- know how to explain why TDD and BDD are such pivotal skills to have as a software engineer
- be able to confidently refactor any piece of code (as you will always have 100% coverage), and you will be able to do so in extremely small increments.
- be able to not only refactor but also extend/modify legacy code that initially did not have any unit tests at all!
- know how to cope with external dependencies to the system under test by applying the [adapter pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)
- be able to work according to the [Detroit and London schools of TDD](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Test-Driven-Development) and know when and how to properly apply mocks, stubs, fakes, spies, etc.

### What general programming skills are required?

These katas are intended for people who want to learn TDD. Some basic programming experience is required, such as knowing what a `class` is, what an `object` is, what a `primitive` is, what `exception handling` entails, and how to write `conditionals` and `loops`. 

Although not strictly required, it will also definitely help if you are already familiar with concepts such as [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) and the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle).

### Is there a preferred programming language?

No, there isn't. There are cookie-cutter templates for many languages available,
but even if there aren't any for your favorite programming language, you can still
do many of the katas. Moreover, the programming language is kind of irrelevant for
practicing the various aspects that are being addressed. I have facilitated 
many [coding dojos](https://codingdojo.org/WhatIsCodingDojo/) where multiple participants were exposed to 
e.g. Python for the first time, and they managed pretty soon pretty well.
