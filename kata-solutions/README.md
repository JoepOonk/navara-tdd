This directory contains some of the many _possible_ solutions for most of the coding katas, with an intentional emphasis on the word possible. As coding katas can and should be practiced multiple times, you generally continually arrive at even better solutions than before. In addition, you may want to exercise with different constraints in different languages:

- Trying to come up with a stateless solution
- Trying to avoid the use of conditionals as much as possible 
- Implement a kata within a traditional object-oriented programming paradigm
- Implement a kata within a more modern functional programming paradigm
- Etc

To summarize, these solutions are not meant to be the "correct" solutions in any sense. 
They are merely meant as a source of inspiration and may be helpful in case you get stuck and just want to continue.
