# Introduction

Use this template when you want to create games in a TDD manner such as Pong, Tetris, and Pacman.

This template creates a game set-up based on [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).

It comes with a pacman-like sprite, depicted as a circle, that can be moved about the canvas.

A suite containing tests is provided as an example.

# Running the game

- Issue `poetry install`
- Use the arrow keys to move 'pacman' about the canvas.

# Running the tests

- Use the `run_tests.sh` script to run the tests once
- use the `run_watch.sh` script to run the tests continuously
