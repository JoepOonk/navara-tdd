> To me, legacy code is simply code without tests &#8212; [Michael Feathers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code)

The site maintained by Nicolas Carlo, [understandlegacycode.com](https://understandlegacycode.com/), boasts a blog post that summarizes [the key points of Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/key-points-of-working-effectively-with-legacy-code/).

Nicolas himself uses a somewhat different definition of legacy code.

> Legacy Code is valuable code youâ€™re afraid to change &#8212; [Nicolas Carlo](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/what-is-legacy-code-is-it-code-without-tests/)

as you may sometimes encounter code without (sufficient) tests, but the code [reveals its intention](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html) so well, that you're not afraid to modify it.
