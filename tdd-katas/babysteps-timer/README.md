# Babysteps timer

This kata contains a working babysteps timer. It can actually be used 
[as a constraint](https://kata-log.rocks/baby-steps) when practicing TDD! 

The idea is that writing a failing test and making
it green, should be possible within 2 minutes. If not, all changes should
be reverted (.e.g. `git checkout`). The same holds for the refactoring phase.

Note that the babysteps timer can (should?) even be used during its own refactoring ðŸ˜„

## Goal of the babysteps timer kata

The constraint is to write tests for the babysteps timer before refactoring
the Typescript code. A first example test has already been provided to get
you started, but feel free to throw that (somewhat) useless test away!
