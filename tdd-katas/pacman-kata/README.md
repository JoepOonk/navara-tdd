![Pacman](pacman.jpg)

# Introduction

This kata brings together the techniques that we practiced in many other katas such as

- Steering Pacman left, right, up, and, down much like we did in the [mars rover kata](../mars-rover)
- Applying [ports and adapters](https://github.com/zhendrikse/tdd/wiki/Hexagonal-Architecture) to isolate all the calls to the gaming engine framework
- Determining the distances in the Pacman maze by using the [manhattan distance](../manhattan-distance)
- Working with nodes and neighbors much like we do in the [game of life](../game-of-life)

# Suggestions

1. Use the [cookiecutter template for test-driven development of (Python) games](https://github.com/zhendrikse/tdd/tree/master/cookiecutter)  
2. Start by creating a maze from text, as outlined [here](https://pacmancode.com/maze-basics)
3. Make Pacman move along the nodes and vertices of this maze, as explained [here](https://pacmancode.com/node-movement-part-1)
4. Add the pellets and eat them
5. Add the ghosts by giving them random movements
6. Etc.
