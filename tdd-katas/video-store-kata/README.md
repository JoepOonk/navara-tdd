# Introduction

This is the famous [video store refactoring kata](https://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoring-video-store-js/)
by [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/). This kata was
subsequently [translated to Java](https://github.com/unclebob/videostore) 
(as well as slightly modified) by [Uncle Bob](https://github.com/unclebob). 
Finally, I personally decided
to translate the version of Uncle Bob to Python.
