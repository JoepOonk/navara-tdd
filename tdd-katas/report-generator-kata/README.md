# Report generation kata

The report generation kata is based on 
[this exercise](https://nbviewer.org/github/jerry-git/learn-python3/blob/master/notebooks/intermediate/exercises/05_idiomatic_python_exercise.ipynb).

## Possible improvement strategies

- Apply some (or perhaps all?) [SOLID principles](https://dnamic.ai/blog/introduction-of-solid-design-principles-by-uncle-bob/)
- Refactor towards more [Python idiomatic code](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/)
- Apply the principles of [clean code in Python](https://testdriven.io/blog/clean-code-python/)
- Make tests independent from the file system ([FIRST](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/unit-tests-are-first-fast-isolated-repeatable-self-verifying-and-timely-a83e8070698e))
