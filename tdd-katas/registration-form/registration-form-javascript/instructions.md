# Introduction

Please read the general [introduction to the registration form kata](../README.md) first!

# Getting started

1. First, create an intial Javascript kata set-up as described 
   [here](https://github.com/zhendrikse/tdd/tree/master/cookiecutter).
2. Next, copy the `index.html`, `index.js`, `helpers.js`, and `style.css` 
   files over to the root folder of your newly generated kata folder.
3. Finally, remove the originally generated Javavscript file in the `src` folder
   and rename the spec file in the `spec` folder to `helper_spec.js`.

You are now ready to start this kata!
