# Registration form kata

## Introduction

This kata is based on a combination of resources:

- The section [How to test Node.js applications with Jasmine](https://www.lambdatest.com/learning-hub/jasmine-unit-testing#how-to-test-nodejs-applications-with-jasmine)
- The HTML page is inspired by the [Aliens' Registration Form with validation](https://codepen.io/absalan/pen/WNbwbXB?editors=1111)
- The project lay-out is inspired by [this Jasmine example](https://github.com/Kaperskyguru/jasmine-example/) available on GitHub.

The idea is to learn how to apply TDD to code that is meant to be used/executed in a front-end.

## Goal

The goal is to build the validation logic belonging to the [Aliens' Registration Form ](https://codepen.io/absalan/pen/WNbwbXB?editors=1111)
using TDD. This way practitioners should get an idea of how the same principles can/should be applied to front-end development.

### Possible extensions

- The app can be made more interesting by persisting the user
  data into a database
