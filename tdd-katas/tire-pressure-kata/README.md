# Tire Pressure Code Kata

A copy of Emily Bache's [tire pressure kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Racing-Car-Katas/tree/main/Python/TirePressureMonitoringSystem), part of the so-called
[racing car katas](https://github.com/emilybache/Racing-Car-Katas/tree/main).

The idea is to test whether or not the alarm goes off whenever the tire pressure
happens to go beyond the (hard-coded) boundaries.
