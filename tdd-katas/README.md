My name is [Zeger Hendrikse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zegerhendrikse/). I am a self-employed IT consultant. I'm a fan of [extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming), [continuous delivery](https://www.continuousdelivery.com/), and [DevOps](https://cloud.google.com/devops) / [DORA](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html). 

This means my heroes are [Dave Farley](https://www.davefarley.net/), [Robert C. Martin](http://blog.cleancoder.com/) (aka Uncle Bob), [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/), [Kent Beck](https://www.kentbeck.com/)... just to name a few.

As I am a huge fan of [Replit](https://replt.com), I decided to share one of my passions with all of you here: TDD (test driven development)!

# About coding katas

> Japanese culture influenced a lot software and project management fields. Concepts like [Lean](https://apiumhub.com/?p=55302), [Kata](https://apiumhub.com/?p=4044), etc has come from Japan. And we should admit, that they have improved the existing processes, increasing efficiency and satisfaction overall &#8212;

In this curriculum, the participant(s) learn TDD by practicing so-called [coding katas](https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/code-kata/):

> A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar &#8212; [codekata.com](http://codekata.com/) 

Generally speaking, each kata tries to target one or more skills, and this curriculum is no exception to that general rule. As the saying goes, practice makes perfect, and the same holds for (coding) katas: preferably you make them your own by repeating them _time and again_.

## Katas to practice TDD

Although the basic rules of TDD are relatively straightforward, TDD turns out to be a skill and as such, has to be acquired. Like playing piano. Like practicing martial arts in a dojo by executing katas time and again!

And although the saying goes that practice makes perfect, the reality is that code almost never reaches a perfect state: you can always find ways to further improve your code and your skill(s). Likewise with TDD, your TDD journey definitely won't stop after completing this course. There are always new ways to become more proficient and faster. Luckily, it turns out that mastery (from [Daniel Pink's Autonomy Mastery Purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)) is one of the three primary drivers that keeps us motivated. Moreover, the pay-off of mastering TDD is much higher than the investments that you'll put in. 

After spending a certain time with TDD, people claim that there is no other way to develop a software. It is almost a learning to type with ten fingers: once you master the skill, you wonder how you ever managed without it.

The primary focus of all katas in this curriculum will be on TDD, but obviously many other programming ascpects will be practiced along the way! Among these are [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)), [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle), [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), [approval testing](https://approvaltests.com/), [mutation testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing), [lift-up conditional refactoring](https://www.eficode.com/blog/advanced-testing-refactoring-techniques-2), to name but a few.  

# Learning Goals

![Skills](./assets/skillz.png)

After following this curriculum, you/your students will:

- be confident to apply both TDD and BDD (behaviour driven development) in day-to-day work by writing executable specifications as opposed to unit tests that are tightly coupled to implementation.
- know how to explain why TDD and BDD are such a pivotal skills to have as a software engineer
- be able to confidently refactor any piece of code (as you will always have 100% coverage), and you will be able to do so in extremely small increments.
- be able to not only refactor but also extend/modify legacy code that initially did not have any unit tests at all!
- know how to cope with external dependencies to the system under test by applying the [adapter pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)
- be able to work according to the [Detroit and London schools of TDD](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Test-Driven-Development) and know when and how to properly apply mocks, stubs, fakes, spies, etc.

# Expected Student Background

### What general programming skills are required?

This course is designed for students that want to learn TDD. Some basic programming experience is required, such as knowning what a `class` is, what an `object` is, what a `primitive` is, what `exception handling` entails, and how to write `conditionals` and `loops`. 

Although not scritly required, it will also definitely help if the students have already heard of concepts such as [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) and the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle).

---

### Does the student need to be proficient in Python?

It definitely helps if you know how to apply these concepts in Python, but strictly speaking this is not necessary. In the many [coding dojos](https://codingdojo.org/WhatIsCodingDojo/) that I facilitated, multiple participants were exposed to Python for the first time, and they managed pretty soon pretty well.

### Can't I complete the katas in my own favorite language? 

For the brave at heart, it is possible to complete all katas in your favorite programming language. If you need any assistance with that, don't hesitate to reach out to me, as for many of these katas I have Javascript/Java/Typescript/Swift/etc alternatives on the shelves.
